pyp5
====

**Disclaimer: this is a work in progress!**

[p5.js](https://p5js.org) in the Jupyter Notebook using the Jupyter Widgets.

This project aims to be a follow-up of [p5-jupyter-notebook](https://github.com/jtpio/p5-jupyter-notebook), so that p5 can be used in JupyterLab (and in the classic Notebook) as a proper package.

Contibutions and help welcome!
